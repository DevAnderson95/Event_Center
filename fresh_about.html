                History of Fresh Stock
            
                Fresh Stock is a family owned produce chain of markets that was founded in 1965 by Alex Harper.
                Harper and his family owned a farm just on the edge of their hometown of Bethel, Pennsylvania. 
                They grew fresh fruits and vegetables and would travel into town to sell and provide to the community.
                Harper would set up a stand with his family in the center of town which he knew would be the perfect area for
                numerous customers. Eventually, the Harpers were able to build a storefront and this would be the first of many markets to come!
                As of today, the Fresh Stock franchise is said to have about 39 markets nationwide!
